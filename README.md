Project: Predicting Housing Prices using Gradient Boosting with Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Tuning 🏠

In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting housing prices using advanced machine learning techniques. Here's a brief summary of what I did:

Data Cleaning: Loaded and cleaned the dataset by dropping missing values to ensure high-quality data for training.
Feature Engineering: Created new interaction features like bedrooms_area and bathrooms_stories to capture relationships between variables.
Log Transformation: Applied log transformation to the target variable to reduce skewness and improve model performance.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and test sets (80/20 split) to evaluate the model’s generalization ability.
Feature Standardization: Standardized features using StandardScaler to ensure fair training across all variables.
Model Training: Used Gradient Boosting Regressor and fine-tuned the model’s hyperparameters (via GridSearchCV) for optimal performance.
Evaluation: Calculated key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared (reversed log transformation) to evaluate the model’s prediction accuracy.
Key Results:

Achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy with well-tuned hyperparameters.
The final model's R-squared was 0.74, indicating a strong fit to the data.
💡 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python, Pandas, Numpy
Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting, GridSearchCV, StandardScaler)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
This project helped me enhance my skills in regression modeling, feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization. Excited to keep learning and applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems! 🔍📊
